# Configuring the Node.js environment
{: #configuration}

Ideally, a Node.js application can move from one environment to another (for example, from testing into production) without changing code, or exercising otherwise untested code paths.

The problem arises when significant differences exist in the way the config is presented, depending on the development environment. For example, CloudFoundry, which uses stringified JSON objects versus Kubernetes that uses either flat values or stringified JSON objects. Local development aside from Kubernetes has different considerations as well. Credentials can be presented differently across public and private, which further make it difficult for apps to be unchanged across environments.

Whether you need to add Cloud support to existing applications or create apps with Starter Kits, the goal is to provide portability for Node.js apps on any development platform.

## Adding Cloud support to existing Node.js applications
{: #addcloud-env}

The [`ibm-cloud-env`](https://github.com/ibm-developer/ibm-cloud-env) module aggregates environment variables from various Cloud providers, such as CloudFoundry and Kubernetes, so the application is independent of the environment.

### Installing the `ibm-cloud-env` module
1. Install the `ibm-cloud-env` module with the following command:
  ```
  npm install ibm-cloud-env
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Initialize the module in your code by referencing the `mappings.json` like so:
  ```js
  var IBMCloudEnv = require('ibm-cloud-env');
  IBMCloudEnv.init("/path/to/the/mappings/file/relative/to/project/root");
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  If the mappings file path isn't specified in `IBMCloudEnv.init()`, the module tries to load mappings from a default path of `/server/config/mappings.json`.
  {: tip}

  Example `mappings.json` file:
  ```json
  {
    "service1-credentials": {
        "searchPatterns": [
            "cloudfoundry:my-service1-instance-name", 
            "env:my-service1-credentials", 
            "file:/localdev/my-service1-credentials.json" 
        ]
    },
    "service2-username": {
        "searchPatterns":[
            "cloudfoundry:$.service2[@.name=='my-service2-instance-name'].credentials.username",
            "env:my-service2-credentials:$.username",
            "file:/localdev/my-service1-credentials.json:$.username" 
        ]
    }
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

### Using the values in a Node.js app
Retrieve the values in your application by using the following commands.

1. Retrieve variable `service1credentials`:
  ```js
  // this will be a dictionary
  var service1credentials = IBMCloudEnv.getDictionary("service1-credentials");
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Retrieve variable `service2username`:
  ```js
  var service2username = IBMCloudEnv.getString("service2-username"); // this will be a string
  ```
  {: codeblock}

Now your application can be implemented in any runtime-environment by abstracting the differences that are introduced from different Cloud compute providers.

### Filtering the values for tags and labels
You can filter credentials that are generated by the module based on service tags and service labels as shown in the following example:
```js
var filtered_credentials = IBMCloudEnv.getCredentialsForServiceLabel('tag', 'label', credentials)); // returns a Json with credentials for specified service tag and label
```
{: codeblock}

## Using the Node.js configuration manager from Starter Kit apps

Node.js apps that are created with [Starter Kits](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/starter-kits/) automatically come with credentials and configurations that are needed to run in many Cloud deployment environments (CF, K8s, VSI, and Functions).

### Understanding service credentials

Your application configuration information for services is stored in the `localdev-config.json` file in the `/server/config` directory. The file is in the `.gitignore` directory to prevent sensitive information from being stored in Git. The connection information for any configured service that runs locally, such as user name, password, and host name, is stored in this file.

The application uses the configuration manager to read the connection and configuration information from the environment and this file. It uses a custom-built `mappings.json`, which is located in the `server/config` directory, to communicate where the credentials can be found for each service.

Locally running applications can connect to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services by using unbound credentials that are read from the `mappings.json` file. If you need to create unbound credentials, you can do so from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} web console, or by using the [CloudFoundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/) `cf create-service-key` command.

When you push your application to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, these values are no longer used. Instead, the application automatically connects to bound services by using environment variables.

* **Cloud Foundry**: Service credentials are taken from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.

* **Kubernetes**: Service credentials are taken from individual environment variables per service.

* **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Container Service**: Service credentials are taken from VSIs or {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} (Openwhisk).


## Next Steps
{: #next_steps notoc}

The `ibm-cloud-config` supports searching for values by using three search pattern types: `cloudfoundry`, `env`, and `file`. If you would like to check out other supported search patterns and search pattern examples, check the [Usage](https://github.com/ibm-developer/ibm-cloud-env#usage) section.
