# Getting Node.js app support
{: #support-nodejs}

## Asking for help on dWanswers
{: #dwanswers-nodejs}

Ask questions on [dWAnswers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smartspace/nodejs/index.html){: external} by using the `#nodejs` tag or join the discussion in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Slack](https://ibm-cloud-tech.slack.com){: external} within the `#nodejs-at-ibm` channel.

## Using official IBM Support for Runtimes
{: #runtimes-support-nodejs}

IBM Foundation Support for Runtimes provides coverage for Node.js, Swift, and Java. Support is available for Node.js 6 and 8 LTS binaries from the [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/){: external} community, including the IBM SDK for Node.js, that uses the open-sourced [App Metrics](https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/){: external} monitoring framework.

The Node.js runtime support is available regardless of which modules you are using within your application. Support is available for wherever you want to deploy the runtime, whether thatâ€™s on your own computers, in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, or elsewhere.

IBM Advanced Support for Runtimes expands on Foundation Support, providing coverage for Express.js, Loopback, and Kitura (Swift framework) frameworks (including package dependencies).

To learn more, see [IBM's Digital Marketplace](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/support-for-runtimes){: external}.

## Buildpack Support Statement
{: #buildpack-nodejs}

Issues can be reported against any version of the built-in IBM buildpack currently supported on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, however, they must be verified against the latest version. If a defect is found, IBM will provide a fix in a future level of the runtime and corresponding buildpack. For more information, see the [buildpack support statement](/docs/runtimes-common?topic=runtimes-common-buildpack_support_statement).
