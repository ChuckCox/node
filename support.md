# Getting Node.js app support

## Asking for help on dWanswers

Ask questions on [dWAnswers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smartspace/nodejs/) by using the `#nodejs` tag or join the discussion in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Slack](https://slack-invite-ibm-cloud-tech.mybluemix.net/) within the `#nodejs-at-ibm` channel.

## Using official IBM Support for Runtimes

IBM Foundation Support for Runtimes provides coverage for Node.js, Swift, and Java. Support is available for Node.js 6 and 8 LTS binaries from the [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) community, including the IBM SDK for Node.js, that uses the open-sourced [App Metrics](https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/) monitoring framework.

The Node.js runtime support is available regardless of which modules you are using within your application. Support is available for wherever you want to deploy the runtime: whether thatâ€™s on your own machines, in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, or elsewhere.

IBM Advanced Support for Runtimes expands on Foundation Support, providing coverage for Express.js, Loopback, and Kitura (Swift framework) frameworks (including package dependencies).
