# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started}

The following tutorial walks you through the steps to build, run locally, and deploy a Node.js app by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provided tools. You can use the [{{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_long}}](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on the command line or the web-based [App Development console](https://{DomainName}/developer/appservice/dashboard){: external} as shown in the following tutorial steps. By using either of these methods, you can generate a production-ready Node.js application in just minutes.

Make sure that you are using the latest Node.js LTS release.

## Creating a Node.js app
{: #node-create-project}

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If you don't have an account, you can [register for a free account](https://{DomainName}/registration){: external}.
2. Go to the [App Development console](https://{DomainName}/developer/appservice/starter-kits){: external}, and select a starter kit that is written in `Node.js`, or select the **Create App** tile to use a blank starter kit.
3. In the App details page for the starter kit, name your app, and select a resource group.
4. Optional. Provide tags to classify your app. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/resources?topic=resources-tag).
5. Optional. To inspect the source code before you add services or deploy your app, click **View source code**. The app code includes a `README.md` file that contains technical details about the app. Check the `README.md` file to find out whether you need to take more actions to get your app up and running.
6. Ensure that **Node.js** is selected as the platform, and then click **Create**. After your app is created, you can add services and then deploy it by using a toolchain, or you can continue to build and deploy your project from the [command line](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).
7. If you choose to continue with the CLI instead of the toolchain, download the project to your local machine, `unzip`, and `cd` into the root directory. Now you can install the prerequisites by using your platforms command method:

    MacOS:
    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Windows (run as Administrator):
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Adding a service
{: #node-add-service}

1. Return to your project in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}.
2. Click **Add service**, select the category of the service you want to add, click **Next**, then choose your service. For example, to add a NoSQL database to your application, select the **Data** category, then select **Cloudant**, which offers a Lite plan for free development. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}} provisions the service for you based on the selected plan.
Note: If you previously provisioned the service that you plan to use, choose the **Existing** category.
3. After the service is provisioned, click **Download code** to regenerate the project with the SDK that connects to your service.

## Running apps locally
{: #node-run-local}

1. Use the `ibmcloud dev build` command to build your application.
2. Use the `ibmcloud dev run` command to run the application locally. Your application is run in the Docker containers on your local system. You can test your application in a browser by accessing `http://localhost:3000`.
3. A health check endpoint is available at `http://localhost:3000/health`.

## Deploying to IBM Cloud
{: #deploy_cloud}

Use the `ibmcloud dev deploy` command to deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} as a Cloud Foundry application. 

To deploy to IBM Container Services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, use the following command:
```
ibmcloud dev deploy â€“target container 
```
{: codeblock}
