# Getting started tutorial

The following tutorial walks you through the steps to build, run locally, and deploy a Spring app by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provided tools. You can use the [{{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_long}}](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloudnative/dev_cli.html#add-cli) on the command line or the web-based [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/dashboard) as shown in the following tutorial steps. By using either of these methods, you can generate a production-ready Node.js application in just minutes.

## Creating a Node.js app
{: #create_project}

1. From the [Starter Kits](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/starter-kits) page in the {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}, select a Starter Kit that is written in `Node.js`. You can also create a blank starter app by clicking **Create app** and selecting `Node.js` as the language.

    You must be logged in to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to create a project. If you do not have an account, you can [register for a free account](https://console.bluemix.net/registration).
    {: tip}

2. Click **Create App**.
3. **Name** your app. A generic app name is provided if you want to use that.
4. Enter a **unique host name**. The host name is used to access your application, for example: `expressjs-project.mybluemix.net`.
5. Click **Create**. After your project is created, you can deploy by using a toolchain or you can continue to build, and deploy your project from the command line.
6. If you choose to create a toolchain, click **Deploy to the cloud**, and select one of the following deployment methods.
    * **Cloud Foundry App** - You do not need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
    * **Kubernetes Cluster** - You must provision a set of worker nodes. For example, you can use VMs to deploy and manage highly available application containers. You can create a cluster or deploy to an existing cluster.

7. Finalize your options, and then click **Create** to create the toolchain.

8. If you choose to continue with the CLI instead of the toolchain, download the project to your local machine, `unzip`, and `cd` into the root directory. Now you can install the prerequisites by using your platforms command method:

    MacOS:
    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Windows (run as Administrator):
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Adding a service
{: #add_service}

1. Return to your project in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}}.
2. Click **Add Service**, select the category of the service you want to add, click **Next**, then choose your service. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.dev_console}} provisions the service for you based on the selected plan.
Note: If you previously provisioned the service that you plan to use, choose the **Existing** category.
3. After the service is provisioned, click **Download Code** to regenerate the project with the SDK that connects to your service.

## Running apps locally
{: #run_local}

1. Use the `ibmcloud dev build` command to build your application.
2. Use the `ibmcloud dev run` command to run the application locally. Your application is run in the Docker containers on your local system. You can test your application in a browser by accessing `http://localhost:3000`.
3. A health check endpoint is available at `http://localhost:3000/health`.
4. You can access the [App Metrics](https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/) dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/appmetrics-dash`.

## Deploying to Cloud
{: #deploy_cloud}

Use the `ibmcloud dev deploy` command to deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} as a Cloud Foundry application. 

To deploy to IBM Container Services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, use the following command:
```
ibmcloud dev deploy â€“target container 
```
{: codeblock}

## Next Steps
{: #nextsteps}

Continue checking out the topics the Node.js programming guide, or for more advanced deployments, you can learn to create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy your Node.js app to it.
